# Zero-Trust-Threat
AI-Driven Multi-Agent Cybersecurity Command Center  
with Compressed Threat Intelligence & Consensus-Based Decision Framework

---> Overview

Zero-Trust-Threat is an advanced Security Operations Platform that combines:

- Real anomaly clustering
- Compressed threat intelligence
- Multi-agent deliberative reasoning
- Dynamic zero-trust scoring
- Human-in-the-loop governance

Instead of relying on single-model detection or rule-based alerts, the system forms structured consensus across multiple intelligent agents before recommending containment actions.


---> Modern SOC environments suffer from:

- Alert fatigue due to high false positives
- Isolated event analysis without behavioral compression
- Static risk scoring mechanisms
- Limited explainability in AI-driven decisions

Security teams require systems that:
- Compress massive log streams into meaningful threat representations
- Reason across multiple perspectives
- Provide explainable and governable decision outputs
- Align with zero-trust principles

---> Core Innovations

->1. Compressed Threat Intelligence via Clustering

Raw security logs are:

1. Parsed and structured
2. Converted into behavioral feature vectors
3. Clustered using ML-based anomaly detection

Instead of storing 10,000 raw events,
the system produces compact behavioral clusters representing attack patterns.

Each cluster includes:
- Event density metrics
- Temporal characteristics
- Feature consistency scores
- Outlier strength
- Cluster confidence index

This reduces noise and improves detection clarity.
- Behavioral verification before trust assignment
- Risk-based access logic simulation


-> 2. Multi-Agent Consensus Engine (Novelty Layer)

Each suspicious cluster is evaluated by independent reasoning agents:

- Behavioral Analysis Agent
- Contextual Risk Agent
- Threat Classification Agent
- Integrity Drift Agent (optional)
- Risk Aggregation Agent

Each agent produces:
- Threat probability
- Confidence score
- Structured reasoning output

The Consensus Engine:

- Aggregates agent outputs
- Measures disagreement levels
- Computes final risk score
- Produces explainable decision summary

If agents strongly disagree:
→ Confidence decreases  
→ Escalation threshold increases  

This prevents overconfident automated decisions.


-> 3. Dynamic Zero-Trust Model

Every entity (IP, device, user) maintains a dynamic trust score:

Trust(t) = Trust(t-1) − Behavior Drift − Threat Match + Recovery Factor

Trust decays when:
- Cluster involvement increases
- Threat fingerprints match
- Integrity drift rises

Trust recovers gradually during clean behavior periods.

This implements continuous verification rather than static classification.

-> 4. Assisted Self-Healing with Human Oversight

When risk exceeds threshold:

The Remediation Planning Agent proposes:

- IP blocking
- Device isolation
- Account suspension
- Credential rotation

Before execution:

- Impact Simulation Agent estimates operational effects
- Confidence score is presented
- Rollback plan is generated

Final action requires administrator approval.

This ensures AI governance and prevents unsafe automation.

---> Threat Evolution Tracking

Clusters are tracked over time to model:

- Behavioral progression
- Risk escalation
- Trust decay trajectory

This enables temporal threat graph analysis rather than static alerting.


---> Metrics (To Be Evaluated)

- Log Compression Ratio
- Cluster Stability Score
- Agent Disagreement Index
- Detection Latency
- Trust Decay Responsiveness
