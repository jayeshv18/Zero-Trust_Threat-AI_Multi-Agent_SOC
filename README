# Zero-Trust-Threat
AI-Driven Cybersecurity Command Center with Threat Fingerprinting

## Problem Statement

Modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs) process millions of logs daily.  
Traditional systems rely heavily on rule-based detection, resulting in:

- High false positives
- Delayed threat identification
- Poor scalability
- Lack of behavioral intelligence

There is a need for a zero-trust, AI-driven system that can:

- Compress massive security logs
- Detect anomalies in real-time
- Generate reusable threat fingerprints
- Reduce alert fatigue

## Solution Overview

Zero-Trust-Threat is an AI-powered cybersecurity command center that:

1. Ingests system and network logs
2. Converts them into structured behavioral representations
3. Uses embedding-based anomaly detection
4. Clusters suspicious activity patterns
5. Generates a unique "Threat DNA Fingerprint"
6. Enables zero-trust response simulation

The system reduces thousands of logs into compact behavioral threat signatures.


## Key Innovation: Threat DNA Fingerprinting

Instead of treating every alert independently, the system:

- Groups related abnormal events
- Extracts behavioral features
- Generates a compressed fingerprint ID
- Stores reusable threat profiles

When similar behavior appears again, detection is faster and more precise.

This enables:

- Threat pattern reuse
- Faster containment
- Reduced processing overhead

## Architecture

### 1. Log Ingestion Layer
- Simulated or real-time logs
- Structured parsing

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Event normalization
- Behavioral feature encoding

### 3. Embedding Engine
- Convert logs to vector representations
- Semantic clustering of anomalies

### 4. Threat Clustering
- Identify abnormal clusters
- Risk scoring

### 5. Zero-Trust Response Engine
- Assign severity levels
- Suggest containment actions
- Simulated auto-isolation


## Tech Stack

Backend:
- Python
- FastAPI

## Expected Impact

- Log compression ratio: 10,000 logs → < 50 threat clusters
